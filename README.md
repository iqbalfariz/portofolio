### App Description
MyBluebird is an application from the Bluebird Group, where users can book various taxi services from Bluebird. The features available in the app include Ride, Rent, Delivery, and EzPay. With these features, users can book or rent taxis online. Users can also directly order a taxi at their location and make cashless payments using the EzPay feature.

### Contributed Techincally
The MyBluebird project was developed using the Kotlin programming language and Android Studio. This project follows a clean architecture, utilizes the MVVM pattern, employs Koin for dependency injection, and implements data binding. During its development, I contributed to enhancing various features within the Ride, Rent, and Delivery modules. Additionally, I integrated new features with API endpoints provided by the backend team using Kotlin Retrofit and Kotlin Coroutines. I also worked on bug fixes based on bug reports identified during the regression and alpha testing phases prior to the release of the latest application version.

### App Description
Fatless is an application created by me and my friends during our participation in the Finance and Health Hackathon 2022. Fatless is designed to calculate the percentage of body fat in users based on criteria such as gender, age, height, and more. It also provides a classification of body fat based on gender and the user's body fat percentage.

### Contributed Technically
The Fatless project was developed using the Kotlin programming language and Android Studio. The user interface for Fatless was created using XML and implemented with view binding. In this project, my contributions included implementing the design that was created in Figma and resolving the bugs that were discovered during its development.
